# Functional Programming course @ EPFL 2019

This is my main solution repository for the [**FunProg 2019 course**](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/fr/functional-programming-CS-210?cb_cycle=bama_cyclebachelor&cb_section=sc).

These solutions should lead to a 10 out of 10 for the Functional Programming assignments. 
At least it did in 2019 ;)

You can find full course repo [here](https://gitlab.epfl.ch/lamp/cs-210-functional-programming-2019) and tool setup page [here](https://gitlab.epfl.ch/lamp/cs-210-functional-programming-2019/blob/master/week1/00-tools-setup.md) if needed.

## Have fun through this course!
