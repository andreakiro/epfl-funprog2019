# Functional Programming course @ EPFL 2019

This is my main solution repository for the [**FunProg 2019 course**](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/fr/functional-programming-CS-210?cb_cycle=bama_cyclebachelor&cb_section=sc).

These solutions should lead to a 10 out of 10 for the Functional Programming assignments. 
At least it did in 2019 ;)

## Have fun through this course!
